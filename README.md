# neoFomo
- One-Stop-Shop for Level-1

## Goals
- An easily maintainable resource centre for neo Level-1 students
- A quick way to get in pace with the learning community
- Keep it small but useful, do one thing and do it well
- Journal based, with daily logging of activities within the learning community
- Major goals:
    - Not to let anyone in the community feel [FOMO](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fomo)
    - Expose the beginners to various git operations in a collaborative setup
      viz. pull, fetch, merge, stash, pop, resolving merge conflicts, pull
      requests and many more.
